# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository is my personal learning hub for Artificial Intelligence (AI). I will store **notes**, **important questions**, and **programs** related to AI topics. I will only include content that confuses me or is important to note, to keep track of key concepts and clarify doubts.

## Repository Structure
- **Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence/**: General AI concepts.
  - `notes/`: Key ideas and summaries.
  - `questions/`: Confusing or important questions with answers.
  - `programs/`: Code implementations (e.g., Python).
- **Introduction-to-Machine-Learning/**: Machine learning topics.
  - `notes/`: ML concepts and explanations.
  - `questions/`: Key ML questions.
  - `programs/`: ML algorithms and examples.
- **Other-Topics/**: Future topics (e.g., Deep Learning, NLP).
  - `notes/`, `questions/`, `programs/`: Similar structure.

## Purpose
- Document concepts that are hard to understand or critical to remember.
- Save questions that challenge me, along with their explanations.
- Store programs to practice AI implementations.
- Organize content by topic for easy reference.
